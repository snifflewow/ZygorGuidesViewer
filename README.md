# VanillaEpochLeveling

# PROJECT CURRENTLY IN STANDBY, WAITING FOR EPOCH UPDATES
# Current focus is on fixing alliance night elf 1-60. 
# Do not use this version of the addon if you are playing horde

## Overview

This is a port of Zygor 3.3.5 addon to Project Epoch (Vanilla+ 1-60), with the following guides :

- **(Recommended) Zygor Leveling Guide** : Era guide backported to 3.3.5
  - All credits go to Zygor for the original guide !

The goal of this project is to have a strong leveling base with Zygor, then to expand them as new quests are discovered.

Important : Coordinates might be incorrect in some places since NPCs have been moved around (known issues : Stormwind and Goldshire). Please report any bugs you see in the Github issues.

## Installing

Either :

- **(Recommended) Use [GitAddonsManager](https://woblight.gitlab.io/overview/gitaddonsmanager/). Then change the folder name to `ZygorGuidesViewer` (the name is very important, otherwise the addon won't load)**
- (Alternative for git users) Clone the repository in your `Addon` folder with name `ZygorGuidesViewer`
- (Not recommended as you will not get updates) Download the Addon as a zip file, unzip it in your Addon folder, rename the extrated folder to `ZygorGuidesViewer`

## Contributing

Overall, the plan is to make this project community-based since there is a massive amount of new quests / items added with Project Epoch,
and I will not be able to go through all the content myself so I rely on the Epoch community to suggest leveling routes !

In order to contribute :

- Open an issue [in Github here](https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/VanillaEpochLeveling/issues) with the changes you think should be made. Each issue should cover 1 change "idea"
  (eg. you can include multiple quests change in 1 zone if they relate to each other in the route. Changes across multiple zones should be split except if related).
- If you would like to directly implement the change in the code base, create [a pull request](https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/VanillaEpochLeveling/pulls) linking to an issue.
  - Note : you will need `stylua` to format the lua code, [see here](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) for installation
  - Use `make format` to apply formatting or make sure your IDE uses `stylua`

Please read the guide format [here](./guide_format.html) on how to write Zygor formatted guides (open in your browser).

In order to get quest / items / NPC IDs and location, check the [pfquest-Epoch](https://github.com/Bennylavaa/pfQuest-epoch) db or questie epoch (whichever you prefer).

## Notes

Another reason I initially split the guide into subfiles which are not lua is to be able to have syntax highlighting (+ potentially LSP features) in IDEs for the zygor guides which are written in a custom language.

Since I use neovim for development, I wrote this small treesitter parser/highlighting (experimental) : [https://github.com/SimonGaufreteau/tree-sitter-zygor].

All credits for the Addon and the base Zygor guide go to Zygor !
