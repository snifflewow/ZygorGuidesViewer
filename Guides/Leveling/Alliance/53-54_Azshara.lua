|tip You are about to go back to Un'Goro Crater soon, and have to fight higher level enemies, so being a level higher is important.
|tip This is the last long grind you will have to do before reaching level 60.
|tip These Blood Elves drop Runecloth, and you will need 240 Runecloth for cloth turn ins in the major cities, for a quick burst of xp.
|tip If you'd rather run dungeons to reach level 54, skip this step and run dungeons after you hearth back to Ratchet soon.
|tip Blood Elf Reclaimers are ranged attackers that deal heavy damage.	|only if hardcore
|tip Enemies may bunch together so be careful.				|only if hardcore
