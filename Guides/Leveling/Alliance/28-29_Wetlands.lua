_NOTE:_
Save Cloth in Your Bank as You Level
|tip Once you are close to reaching level 60, you will need 240 of each type of cloth.
|tip As you level and collect Silk Cloth naturally from killing enemies while following the guide, make sure you deposit the cloth into a bank whenever you are near one.
|tip This will give you about 40,000 quick and easy xp to help you get to level 60 faster in the longer later levels.
