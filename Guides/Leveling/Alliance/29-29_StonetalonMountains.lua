_Note_
This questing area is one of the slower ones.
|tip There are not many better quests right now that are safe to do.
|tip This is one of the few times dungeons are faster than questing.
|tip It is acceptable to do dungeons until level 30.50 and skip this guide, there are no important chains missed.
|tip If you skip ahead, your next guide is Wetlands (30-31)
