Optional Route Change
|tip You can opt to do The Stockades around level 28 instead of grinding.
|tip This will mean slower leveling but it will be more fun and potentially give you gear upgrades.
|tip If you choose to do The Stockades, we will say when to accept and turnin dungeon quests that are worth doing in your route.
|tip We will also say when it is a good time to do the dungeon.
_Note_
|tip This feature is currently experimental and may result in a full quest log. If this happens, please submit a feedback report so we can fix it!
|tip If you have a full quest log, we recommend abandoning any dungeon quests that can be shared by your party members later.
