_NOTE:_
Save Cloth in Your Bank as You Level
|tip Once you are close to reaching level 60, you will need 240 of each type of cloth.
|tip As you level and collect Runecloth naturally from killing enemies while following the guide, make sure you deposit the cloth into a bank whenever you are near one.
|tip This will give you about 40,000 quick and easy xp to help you get to level 60 faster in the longer later levels.
Click Here to Continue |confirm
|only if level < 60
step
Optional Route Change
|tip You can opt to do Maraudon soon instead of grinding.
|tip This is highly recommended due to the weapon quest reward. |only if Hunter or Rogue or Warrior
|tip This will mean slower leveling but it will be more fun and potentially give you gear upgrades.
|tip If you choose to do Maraudon, we will say when to accept and turnin dungeon quests that are worth doing in your route.
|tip We will also say when it is a good time to do the dungeon.
_Note_
|tip This feature is currently experimental and may result in a full quest log. If this happens, please submit a feedback report so we can fix it!
|tip If you have a full quest log, we recommend abandoning any dungeon quests that can be shared by your party members later.
